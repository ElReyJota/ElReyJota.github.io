One more pick and we would necessarily have at least 30 of either red or blue, so the minimum number of picks would be 59.\nBy Theorem 11.3.3, \\(n\\) must be at least \\(k(b-1)+1\\). We are mapping from ball picks to colors. The size of the codomain is the number of colors, which is \\(k=2\\). How many balls must be picked to ensure there are at least 30 balls of the same color? We have a function mapping from some number \\(n\\) elements to a set with \\(k=2\\) elements, red and blue. We want to guarantee that there is an element \\(y\\) in the codomain {red,blue} to which the function maps at least \\(b=30\\) elements from the domain.\nSo, \\(n=k(b-1)+1 = 2*(30-1)+1 = 59\\).\nMap sock picks to colors. The size of the codomain is the number of colors, which is \\(k=2\\). The goal for the number of picks required to guarantee at least 6 socks of the same color is \\(2*(6-1)+1 = 11\\)\nMap marbles to colors. There are \\(k=3\\) colors in the codomain and we want at least \\(b=4\\) marbles of the same color.\n\\(3*(4-1)+1 = 10\\)\nMap sentences to letters. There are \\(k=26\\) letters, and we want at least \\(b=4\\) sentences that start with the same letter.\n\\(26*(4-1)+1 = 79\\)\n\n\n\nSample Solution 12.8\n\nfrom math import ceil\ndef distribute_apples(n, k):\n    result = []\n    while k &gt; 0:\n        result.append(ceil(n/k))\n        n = n - ceil(n/k)\n        k = k - 1\n    return result\n\nprint(distribute_apples(9,4))\n\n[3, 2, 2, 2]\n\n\n\n# Alternative solution by Brycen Taylor, Spring 2023\ndef distribute_apples(n, k):\n  distributeList = [n//k]*k\n  i = 0\n  while i &lt; n%k:\n    distributeList[i] += 1\n    i += 1\n\n  return distributeList\n\nprint(distribute_apples(9, 4))\n\n[3, 2, 2, 2]\n\n\n\n# Alternative solution by Michael Hendrick, Spring 2023\nfrom math import ceil\ndef distribute_apples(n, k):\n    min = n // k\n    rem = n % k\n    return [min + (1 if i &lt; rem else 0) for i in range(k)]\n\nprint(distribute_apples(9,4))\n\n[3, 2, 2, 2]"
